            Across Scandinavia, primary school looks very different than it does in the rest of the world.
            While no two countries are exactly the same, throughout Scandinavia we see a greater focus on experience-based holistic learning,
            with a large emphasis on ensuring each child can develop, and have their needs met.
            One fantastic example of such a difference, is the prevalence of Danish Forest Kindergartens,
            in which students spend the vast majority of their day outside, with freedom to explore and learn at their own pace.
            According to Jane Williams-Siegfredsen, a Forest Kindergarten pedagogue from Denmark, this system results in
            "…a more child-centred approach to learning and development evolved, leading to more humanistic beliefs around childcare and education."

            In addition to teaching more holistic and humanistic beliefs,
            Anu Partanen tells us that Scandinavian primary education as a focus on actual learning and development of skills,
            rather than just being a setup stage for high school and higher education.
            Absence of standardized tests and grading move the focus away from strict curriculums towards a more inclusive and effective system
            where students can be taught and learn based on their individual needs.

              Beyond just the students, Scandinavian educational systems are notably different in terms of the quality
              of instructors and the funding received by schools. “While U.S. public schools are locally funded,
              usually from property taxes, and rewarded based on high performance through programs such as the U.S.
              Department of Education's Race to the Top grants, Finnish schools are nationally funded based on the number of students.
              Schools are provided additional funding if they have a higher proportion of immigrants or
              students whose parents are uneducated or unemployed…"  (Stanford Report January 2012).
              This equitable funding system ensures that students of all social classes receive quality education,
              and parents are not forced to make the choice between quality education for their children and financial stability.
              This funding system also shows itself in the quality of teachers that can be hired,
              “ 'Teachers in Finland are required to obtain a three-year master's degree, state-funded, before teaching.
              These education positions are highly coveted, Sahlberg said. For example, only one in 10 primary-school teacher
              applicants are accepted.' " (Stanford Report January 2012).

          <p>
            In Finland, when high school students are ready to apply for university-level education,
            they are often faced with two choices – either to go to a University or to a University
            of Applied Sciences (UAS). There are two main differences between the two. The former is
            more research oriented and focused on teaching theory, while the later is more practical
            and professionally oriented. While both often do offer many of the same majors, there are
             certain exceptions. For example, to become a doctor, one must attend a University, and
             if one wants to become a nurse, then they must attend a UAS. Although the University is more academic and research oriented,
              and a UAS is more for those who want to enter a specific profession, this does not
              mean that one option is better than the other. Both of these types of education adequately
              prepare students to enter industry and if there is a statistic worth mentioning, then it
              is that employers tend to prefer those with a master’s degree over those who just have
              a bachelor’s. On the left, we’ve included a table detailing some of the main differences between the two!

              Once admitted and attending college, students do not need to concern themselves with
              funding. Nordic university students get tuition mostly free of charge and even receive
              stipends until they graduate. The amount of this stipend is around $600 a month and is
              enough to pay rent and buy groceries. This not only allows students to indulge in financial
              freedom without having to worry about student loans after they graduate, but also helps
              them become autonomous adults in the process. This system strongly encourages independence
              of every individual and ensures that there is no financial strain on the parents. Part
              of this stipend, however, is taxable and if students choose to work and earn wages over
              certain amounts, then the stipend decreases gradually. Even if economic times are tough
              and there is a necessity for college students to work, then unemployment benefits paired
              with often decently affordable housing still makes it possible for those attending a
              university to live a comfortable life.

        <h2> Vocational and Folk School Education </h2>
        <section>

            Students in Scandinavian countries are given freedom in their education, and this freedom
            is not limited to their activities in the classroom, but also their choice in how they want 
            to continue their education. One of the options for students other than upper secondary school 
            is vocational school. Students who want to learn theoretical subjects can go to upper secondary 
            schools and pursue a path to the university while those who already know what field they want 
            to focus on can enroll in vocational schools. But even then, those who study at a vocational 
            school do not necessarily limit themselves. After getting their initial vocational certificate, 
            students can directly go to the labor force, choose to gain other vocational certificates, delve 
            further into their field and attain an advanced certificate, or even apply to continue studying 
            in universities. After vocational schools, their options remain open to choose where they want 
            to focus their life onto.

            These vocational schools aim to not only tell students about the field that they are learning 
            about, but to produce skilled and employable tradespeople for the society. Students retrieve 
            high-level education of their fields from experienced teachers and then continue their study by
            going into apprenticeship under established companies. Although it takes time and resources, 
            companies are willing to invest in these students as possible future forces. After their apprenticeship, 
            students are then assessed on their skills to re-emphasize what they have learned. By going through 
            this experience, students can gain experience in a real work environment of their field.

              Where traditional education focuses on having their students perform well on a standardized 
              curriculum, the government-funded folk schools focus on allowing their students to learn by 
              themselves. There are no particular age restrictions and students take classes that they are 
              interested in without being forced to by a certain curriculum. Unlike the common understanding, 
              folk schools exempt their students from the concept of scores. This is done to free the students 
              from the “guidelines” given by the grades. With this freedom, students can experiment and genuinely 
              learn the subjects that they want to without any constraints. Without this idea being implanted in 
              the students’ mind, we remove the hesitation that they have whenever they want to try a new concept/idea, 
              but is afraid of it affecting their grades.
              
              By doing this, folk schools hope to achieve ethical and creative growth of their students. The students 
              can now think and experiment with their lives however they want, be it in learning and creating music, 
              going outside to ride kayaks, or even picking up a new language. Now that the school’s focus is not creating 
              grades, they can focus on creating a collaborative environment where students grow closer to their peers. 
              Within this environment where adults live and study together, they can mature and understand social 
              interactions along with their fellow students. Being freed from the stress of having to “follow the rubrics”, 
              the students in Folk schools can receive a very specific education tailored to their own learning style and 
              grow with their classmates.
